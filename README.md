# BESCII pixel font

An 8x8 pixel font based on PETSCII for [BASIC Engine](http://basicengine.org/).

![All characters](images/bescii-chars.png?raw=true)

This font was inspired by the Commodore 64 font (PETSCII), but with some modifications to correct a few flaws, and a unique idiosyncracy that gives it a special flavour. You can read a _post mortem_ that details how it was created in [my blog](https://damianvila.com/blog/20240515-designing-the-bescii-font.html).

Pixel art is included in the Private Use Are, to allow for easy game creation.  

A glyphs reference chart is included in the **demo** folder.

## Features
